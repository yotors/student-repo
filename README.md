# Student Fixing Challenge

Welcome to the **Student Fixing Challenge** repository! This project is designed for you to practice identifying and fixing errors in HTML and CSS. 

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started:

This project aims to simplify and guide the way beginners make their first contribution. If you are looking to make your first contribution, follow the steps below.

_If you're not comfortable with command line, [here are tutorials using GUI tools.](#tutorials-using-other-tools)_

#### If you don't have git on your machine, [install it](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git).

## Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/clone.png" alt="clone this repository" />

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yotor/student-repo.git
   cd student-repo
   ```
## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```bash
cd first-contributions
```

Now create a branch using the `git switch` command:

```bash
git switch -c your-new-branch-name
```
replacing `your-branch-name` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

Open the Project: Use your favorite code editor to open index.html and styles.css.
Identify Issues: Carefully review the files and look for:
Incorrect or missing HTML tags.

CSS and bootstrap links.

CSS properties that aren't applied as intended.

Problems with the responsive design.

Fix the Errors: Make the necessary corrections to improve the HTML and CSS.

Test Your Changes: Open index.html in a web browser to preview your changes and ensure everything looks good.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```bash
git push -u origin your-branch-name
```

replacing `your-branch-name` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

## Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.

<img style="float: right;" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/compare-and-pull.png" alt="create a pull request" />

Now submit the pull request.

Challenge Hints:

Here are some tips to help you with your fixes:

HTML Structure: Make sure all HTML elements are properly nested and that every tag is closed.
CSS Selectors: Verify that your CSS selectors accurately target the intended HTML elements.
Utilize Bootstrap: Explore Bootstrap classes to enhance the layout and make the design responsive.
Developer Tools: Use your browser's developer tools (usually F12) to inspect elements, test changes in real-time, and debug any issues.
